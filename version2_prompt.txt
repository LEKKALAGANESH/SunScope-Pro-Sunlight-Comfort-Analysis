## ✅ Improved Prompt (Version 2 – Detailed Product & UX Specification)

**Prompt:**

> Review the current implementation of the application and design **Version 2**, focusing on improving usability, clarity, accuracy, and overall user experience.
>
> Begin with **thorough research** into best practices for architectural editors, 3D modeling tools, and environmental analysis platforms. Use findings to justify UX and interaction decisions before implementation.

### 1. **Validate Section – Auto-Detection Results**

* In the **Auto-Detection Results** panel (right side), buildings, amenities, and other detected elements are currently selectable, but **imported buildings do not appear elsewhere in the system**.
* Investigate why these options exist and how users expect them to behave.
* Redesign this flow so that:

  * Auto-detected and imported elements are clearly visible, traceable, and usable across subsequent sections.
  * The purpose of each selectable item is obvious to the user.
* Add a clear **“Import & Continue”** button at the bottom of this section.

  * When clicked, users are taken to the next step: **Setup**.
  * The transition should confirm what data has been imported and will be used next.

### 2. **Buildings Section – Tools, Editing, and Canvas Behavior**

**Left Panel (Tools & Buildings):**

* Both **Tools** and **Buildings** panels should:

  * Be **collapsed by default**.
  * Support explicit expand/collapse interaction.
* Remove **Quick Shapes** (all four default shapes) from the Tools section.

**Editing Improvements:**

* When drawing buildings:

  * Users currently struggle to select or snap to edges when points are very close.
  * Research precision-editing techniques (snapping thresholds, edge highlighting, zoom-based sensitivity).
  * Improve edge selection and point placement so users can accurately define complex footprints.

**Canvas Interaction:**

* If the user expands both **Tools** and **Buildings** panels:

  * The editor canvas should **automatically scroll or pan** to keep the edited building fully visible.
  * This motion should be smooth and predictable, ensuring users always see the impact of their actions.

### 3. **Analyze Section – Controls, Visualization, and Insights**

**Layout & Expand/Collapse:**

* Left-side controls (Buildings navigation, views, section cuts, display options) and right-side controls (time/date, sun position, animation, current analysis):

  * Must support **expand/collapse**.
  * Default state should be **collapsed**.
* When users expand or collapse panels:

  * The central 3D model should **reflow and animate smoothly** to occupy available space.

**Building Visualization:**

* Display **vertical floor indicators** on each building:

  * Floors should be visually separated using subtle color differences.
  * This should aid quick identification without visual clutter.

**Interactive Floor Insights:**

* On hover (or focus) over a building or specific floor:

  * Show a contextual popup.
  * Include:

    * Floor number
    * Time ranges when direct sunlight occurs
    * Total sunlight duration for that floor
    * Any relevant comfort or exposure indicators
* Research how leading tools present per-floor solar insights and adapt best patterns.

### 4. **Sun Path, Climate, and Real-World Accuracy**

* The sun must:

  * Follow a **fixed orbital path** relative to the scene.
  * Move along that orbit smoothly during animation.
* The orbit should **automatically adapt** based on:

  * Geographic latitude and longitude
  * Seasonal conditions (summer, winter, equinoxes)
* Research real-world sun-path models and ensure:

  * Seasonal altitude and azimuth changes are reflected accurately.
  * Animations feel natural and physically plausible.

**Additional Adjustments:**

* Reduce excessive spacing between buildings in graphs or visualizations so the scene feels realistic.
* Remove the **north-direction arrow** from the 3D graph to reduce visual noise.
* When both left and right panels are collapsed:

  * The 3D model should expand to occupy the full available area, creating a highly immersive experience.

---

### 5. **Results & Overall UX Enhancements**

* The **View Results** section is generally effective.
* Review it alongside the rest of the application to:

  * Improve clarity, visual hierarchy, and consistency.
  * Add any missing insights or contextual explanations that would improve user understanding.
* Evaluate all remaining components and interactions.

  * If research reveals UX improvements or features commonly expected in similar tools, incorporate them thoughtfully.

---

### 6. **Version 2 Objective**

* Integrate all the above enhancements into **Version 2** of the product.
* Ensure:

  * Clear user guidance at every step
  * Smooth transitions and animations
  * Accurate, transparent analysis
  * A polished, professional, and intuitive user experience suitable for real-world architectural and environmental exploration.
